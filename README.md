In this repositorium are present the files used on the disertation "Triple Series Representation of The Pricing Formula for na European Call Option under the Variance Gamma model" and follows the same structure:

To confirm the values computed in Section 5.1. run  the file "Numerical Results - 5.1. Variance Gamma Formula Values.m".
To confirm the values computed in Section 5.2. run the file "Numerical Results - 5.2. Convergence of the Variance Gamma Formula.m".
To confirm the values computed in Section 5.3. run the file "Numerical Results - 5.3. Option price behavior for the Variance Gamma formula.m".
To confirm the values computed in Section 5.4. run the file "Numerical Results - 5.4. The Greeks formulas behavior.m".
