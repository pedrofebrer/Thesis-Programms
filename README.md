# Thesis-Programms

In this repository are present the files used on the 2020 dissertation "Triple Series Representation of The Pricing Formula for an European Call Option under the Variance Gamma model" and it follows the same structure:

To confirm the values computed in Section 5.1, run the "Numerical Results - 5.1. Variance Gamma Formula Values.m" file.
To confirm the values computed in Section 5.2, run the "Numerical Results - 5.2. Convergence of the Variance Gamma Formula.m" file.
To confirm the values computed in Section 5.3, run the "Numerical Results - 5.3. Option price behavior for the Variance Gamma formula.m" file.
To confirm the values computed in Section 5.4, run the "Numerical Results - 5.4. The Greeks formulas behavior.m" file.
